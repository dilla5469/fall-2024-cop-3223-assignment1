//I genuinely tried to do this assignment plenty of times, i started it various times throughout the week and have spent hours reviewing the material but its too much
//The various tweaks made to the submission, as well as having to update the repo, just made it way too confusing.
//It is not ideal to have 5 different pages open each with unique instructions as well as the lecture recordings for reference as well as my codespaces.
//I just recovered from a panic attack due to the approaching deadline and how lost i felt doing this assignment
//and came to the conclusion that for my mental health i can't finish this tonight.
